Road accident prone area prediction using Machine Learning

## Description 

We are creating a Machine Learning model that will predict the probability of the type of 
accident that might occur in the area , you are present in. It , will provide you with a 
set of precautionary measures on your dashboard screen in form of alerts. Accidenet prediction 
model can be highly beneficial for prevention of accidnets and save lives in the real world. We, believe if we can achieve the results we are exapecting , it can create a real improvement on raod-safety.
